ENGM4620 Project

This is a simple Python-based nutritional tracker that helps users log their daily food intake and compare it to their personal nutrition goals. The program starts by asking for basic details like height, weight, gender, and goals (whether they want to gain or lose weight). Based on this info, it calculates suggested daily macronutrient targets (calories, protein, carbs, and fats). Users can then input the foods they eat throughout the day, and the tracker adds everything up, showing whether they are above or below their targets. It's a straightforward tool designed to make it easier to keep track of daily nutrition without complicated apps.
